REM Build a Windows executable for server/app.py using PyInstaller.
REM Run from the repo root on Windows (or under Wine) with Python installed.
REM
REM IMPORTANT -- why the build is deployed to an ASCII-only path:
REM This repo lives under a directory whose name contains Hangul.
REM Windows Defender Firewall stores its per-program
REM allow rules by executable path, and a non-ASCII path is mangled when the
REM rule is written, so the rule never matches the running process. The
REM firewall then silently drops inbound SYNs from the device client -- the
REM server starts fine, binds 0.0.0.0:5000 and answers on localhost, but the
REM raspberry-pi client can never connect. (Running `python -m server.app`
REM works because the matching process is python.exe under an ASCII-only
REM Anaconda path.) Copying the frozen app to an ASCII-only directory makes
REM the firewall rule match and the client connects.
